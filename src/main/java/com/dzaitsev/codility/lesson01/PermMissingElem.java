 * <br>Find the missing element in a given permutation.

	/**
	 * A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that
	 * <br>exactly one element is missing.
	 * <br>Your goal is to find that missing element.
	 * <br>Write a function:
	 * <br>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
	 * <br>that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.
	 * <br>For example, given array A such that:
	 * <br>A[0] = 2
	 * <br>A[1] = 3
	 * <br>A[2] = 1
	 * <br>A[3] = 5
	 * <br>the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
	 * <br>Assume that:
	 * <br>N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
	 * <br>the elements of A are all distinct;
	 * <br>each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].
	 * <br>Complexity:
	 * <br>expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
	 * <br>expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
	 * <br>Elements of input arrays can be modified.
